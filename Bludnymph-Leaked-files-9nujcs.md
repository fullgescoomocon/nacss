Bludnymph continues to push the boundaries of contemporary art with her innovative and thought-provoking works. She is currently working on a new series of paintings that explore the theme of memory and its relationship to identity. Bludnymph's impact on the art world is significant, as she continues to challenge traditional notions of art and inspire a new generation of artists. Her works are now featured in museums and private collections around the world, and her influence is felt far beyond the art world. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Bludnymph has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Bludnymph has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
